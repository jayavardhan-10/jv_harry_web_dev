    <h1>This is Inline and block elements</h1>
    there are 2 types of elements inline and block elements
    <pre>
        Inline elements: 
                        .. size == space taken 
                        .. allows other inline elemens to take space in same line 
        Block elements :
                        .. whole block, whole line is taken
                        .. if there is any other element then this will throw it down in other line.
                        .. if it is written in some line which is already occupied,,, it just chooses other line
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h2>Example for inline</h2>
    <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>
    <a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube</a>
    <span>this is the content i am inline</span>
    <a href="https://youtube.com"></a>
    <br>
    <pre>-->even if i write the next a tag in next line
            it will perfectly come and sits beside the span only</pre>


    <pre>-->colourign of everything is given in css file</pre>


    <h2>Example for block</h2>
    <p>this is a block code</p>
    <p>this is another block paragraph code written just beside the first one</p>


    <div>this is div block elements</div>
    <pre>-->here still the 2nd paragraph takes a new block as its space</pre>

    <br>
    <pre>-->if u give an inline element here it will be thrown in another line</pre>




    <pre>-->but it is not a case in the inline elements 
        -->those elements give space beside them to the another inline elements
    </pre>
