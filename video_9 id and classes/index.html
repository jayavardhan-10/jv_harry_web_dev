    <font size="+2" > <b>ID</b> </font>
    ..id is the unique identity of some portion 
    ..it wont be same for any two
    ..it cant be more than one to any thing
    An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one
    HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique
    styling and JavaScript manipulations.

<pre>
    <font size="+2"> <b>class</b>  </font>

    ..The class attribute lets you give the <b>same name to multiple HTML elements</b>.
    ..That way, you can easily <u>change their look or behavior all at once.</u>
    .. <b>Classes are not unique</b> and can be assigned to multiple elements.
    ..They are generally <i>used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements.</i>
</pre>

<pre>
    <font size="+2"><b>changes made in css</b></font>
    ..there you can write .classname (dotclassname) and give the required properties
    like colouring bgcoolouring etc over there
